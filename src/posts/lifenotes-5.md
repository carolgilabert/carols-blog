Happy Christmas, friends! Turns out I'm not disciplined enough to write these every week, who knew?

Maybe the weeknotes title is not the most appropriate, but I'm not sure where they'd live otherwise, so bear with while I think this through 🤔

## Did

- On the wind down for Christmas, I did the [Design for Developers course on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers/) and oh my, it's the absolute best! Thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through, so thank you [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) ✨
- Tech Nottingham Secret Santa was great, really enjoyed going round people's doorsteps to drop off presents and wave from afar 🎁
- Christmas was enjoyable, despite not being able to go see my family 💔
- After doing exactly one crafty thing, I've gone full Carol and bought a heckton of crafting equipment, so now I'm obvs praying I retain my focus long enough to do at least one more thing 😅
