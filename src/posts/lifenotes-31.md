## âœ¨ Highlights

- My lovely friend Victor came to visit me from Spain
    - I showed him around some Nottingham spots, like my fav restaurants, Sherwood Forest, the castle, etc.
    - I then went to London for work, and extended the trip by a day so we could hang out there too.
        - We went to a couple of good restaurants, Maene and Fallow - I found Fallow overhyped tho, wasnâ€™t that good ðŸ˜…
- Had my BSL exams and we had a nice picnic after the last exam ðŸ˜Œ
- For Jonathanâ€™s birthday I booked us a dinner + overnight stay + breakfast at Sat Bains, a local Michelin starred restaurant, and it was AMAZING.
- The house situation got unfucked - we negotiated a way forward with the buyers ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸŽ® Played/Read/Watched

- [Die hard 4.0](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/): every christmas I watch the Die Hard films, but I never make it past 3. So went rogue with my friend and watched this one. It was ok.
- [Assassins creed](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2094766/): this was SO BAD. Both my friend and I fell asleep on the sofa with this on. No ragrets.
- [The handmaiden](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4016934/): this was SO GOOD! I love a story that manages to surprise me, and this film did just that, plus itâ€™s stunning.
- [Catastrophe](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4374208/): Iâ€™d never watched the final series so I rewatched the whole thing. Such a fun - and sometimes a little heartbreaking - show.
- [Colin from accounts](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18228732/): this was a recommendation from Thom. It was a really fun watch!
- Kendal mountain tour: the collection of films this year was ok, but not amazing. I did really enjoy the film about some dudes who decided to paraglide halfway up a mountain so they could scale to the top after. Insane stuff!
- [Asteroid city](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14230388/): the story wasnâ€™t amazing, but it had a really great cast so it was a fun watch.
