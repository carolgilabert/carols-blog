## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched

- I started listening to the [Office Ladies podcast](https://officeladies.com) on my walks with Juno and it’s been a lot of fun.
- [A military veteran knows why your employees are leaving](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/a-military-veteran-knows-why-your-employees-are-leaving) by Aaron De Smet and Adria Horn.
- [How we calculate balances](https://monzo.com/blog/2022/02/18/how-we-calculate-balances) by Basma Taha.
- [How to get away with murder](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3205802/) was an entertaining watch.
- Thom hadn’t seen [Shrek](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/) & [Shrek 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298148/) so we had to right that wrong 😂
- [Horizon Forbidden West](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10000886) consumed my every non-work waking moment until I finished it.
- I started [Life is Strange: True Colours](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0082-PPSA02047_00-7091966858853560) but it hasn’t hooked me in yet, so I haven’t made it very far.
- Finished reading [Traces](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/traces-the-memoir-of-a-forensic-scientist-and-criminal-investigator/9781788700634), it was so interesting!
- [Universal Holdout Groups at Disney Streaming](https://medium.com/disney-streaming/universal-holdout-groups-at-disney-streaming-2043360def4f) by Tian Yang
