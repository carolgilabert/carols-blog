## üéÆ Played/Read/Watched

- [ET](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0): they did a 40th anniversary screening at Broadway so Thom and I went to see it.
- [Everything everywhere all at once](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6710474/) (again again!) they did a showing at Broadway with some bonus content so I couldn‚Äôt miss it.
- [Disney's FastPass: A Complicated History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yjZpBq1XBE): this is such a fun video essay on queueing at Disney parks and park operations in general, would highly recommend it.
- [Fear of a Black Hobbit](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-fantasy-sci-fi-racist-criticism/671421/)
- [Double Indemnity](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036775): this had some very dated (aka sexist) scenes, but they were so egregious that it was more funny than anger inducing.
- [Dogtooth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1379182/): caught this on Mubi and it was really good, a disturbing but interesting watch.
- Finished [The Book of Form and Emptiness](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-book-of-form-and-emptiness-winner-of-the-women-s-prize-for-fiction-2022/9781838855277): a sad but hopeful read. I really enjoyed how the story was told.
- Got back on [Fall Guys](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1464-PPSA04478_00-FALLGUYS00000000) after a very long time. Don‚Äôt know why I ever stopped, to be honest, it‚Äôs silly, chaotic and colourful, a match made in heaven for me.
- Finished [Spiderman Miles Morales](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01461_00-MARVELSSMMORALES): I‚Äôd pretty much forgotten I hadn‚Äôt finished this game, so I was delighted to find out I stopped right before the final battles, so I had to do all those while remembering none of the controls üòÖ
- [Uncharted](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA02344_00-UNCHARTEDTRILOGY): I haven‚Äôt really been hooked by any games lately so I went to my library to see what I hadn‚Äôt played before that I might enjoy, so I started the Uncharted series.
- [Don‚Äôt Worry Darling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731256/): despite all the negative reviews, I quite enjoyed this. It was an entertaining film, and Florence Pugh was excellent. It was a shame she didn‚Äôt have more time with Chris Pine cause both of them had a great tension going.
- [Moonage Daydream](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9883832/): I went into this not knowing that much about David Bowie, and I loved it so much! I left the cinema completely awestruck. Do watch it if you get a chance.
