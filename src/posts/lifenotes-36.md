## âœ¨ Highlights

- FFConf was really great fun, as usual. I got to hang out with my lovely web friends and we had delicious vegan food at [Bonsai Plant Kitchen](https://www.bonsaiplantkitchen.co.uk/) in the lunch break. I loved all of the talks, but these two stood out the most to me:
	- [The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI - Maggie Appleton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPoM-h1fK8M)
		- I'm fairly skeptical of AI, so I found Maggie's talk a really good - and not hype driven - overview of where the field is and what the challenges are. 
	- [Exploring the Potential of the Web Speech API in Karaoke - Ana Rodrigues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYqjS2V_VuA)
		- Ana's talk was just so much fun, it really shows how much you can do with web APIs and creativity.
- I went to see Little Simz live with a friend in London, and she was incredible, unsurprisingly.
- The eng christmas party at work was a lot of fun. There was a Dance Dance Revolution machine, nice cocktails, and I got to hang out with my work friends and chat.
- I got to see my impossibly talented friend Sophie perform with her choir, they were so good!
- I finally managed to get a bed ordered and delivered, so I'm no longer sleeping on a mattress on the floor ðŸŽ‰
- Started training sessions with Juno. We're working with a trainer to hopefully get him a little bit calmer, as he is a very nervous baby ðŸ–¤

## ðŸŽ® Played/Read/Watched

- [The Fall](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294189/): I'm not really big on mystery drama shows, but Gillian Anderson is amazing, as usual, and this is a good watch.
- [Strange way of life](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13055264/): This short caught my eye while scrolling Mubi, and it was a fun watch.
- [Good thanks, you?](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9104848/): Another short from Mubi, this one quite sad.
- [I want to die but I want to eat tteokbokki](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/i-want-to-die-but-i-want-to-eat-tteokbokki-the-south-korean-hit-therapy-memoir-recommended-by-bts-s-rm-baek-sehee/7351712): I quite liked this book, it was interesting to read someone's therapy notes. While some of it was relatable, ultimately she's a very different person to me, struggling with very different things, and also doing a different style of therapy than I do, but it was still an interesting read.
- [Why Major Meal Kit Companies Lose 90% of Customers in a Year | WSJ The Economics Of ](https://youtu.be/89u2Ftt23Sk?si=9f3DVXx_DHC0BA_P)
- [Dear Duolingo: Are any words the same in all languages?](https://blog.duolingo.com/words-shared-in-all-languages/)
- [Primer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/): I love time-travelling films, this was a very fun one I watched with my friend Hayden who recommended it.
- [The Morning Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7203552/) series 3: A good series, but not much to say about it.
- [The Menu](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/): I did not expect to like this film going in, but it was really fun and different, I loved it.
- [The internet con: how to seize the means of computation](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation-cory-doctorow/7451797): A friend lent me a copy of this as they thought I might enjoy it. It was a great read, from the overview of how the tech industry evolved to making a case for interoperability as a way to dismantle huge tech companies.
