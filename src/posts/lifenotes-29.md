## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched

- [The crane wife](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/07/16/the-crane-wife/) by CJ Hauser
- [Ted Lasso](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986410/) series 3: was a fun watch as usual, and I enjoyed the ending 😊
- [Grace and Frankie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3609352/) series 7: was a fun series, but I think I’m kinda done with this show.
- [CODA](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366460/): really enjoyed this one, I love Marlee Matlin, so was treat to see her as a lead.
- [Jury Duty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22074164/): I started watching this cause the premise was funny, but I kinda trailed off halfway.
- [Atlanta](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4288182/) series 3: this series had a bit more abstract / disconnected stories, but I really enjoyed them, as well as the main character stories, which were great as usual.
- [Fire of love](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16227014/): this is a beautiful documentary! I knew nothing about them or much about vulcanology, so it was really interesting, and all the imagery is very striking.
- [Boom for Real: The Late Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7210348/): very interesting doc about how Basquiat started his career, and the people who surrounded him at the time.
- [Me before you](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2674426/): this was a sad romcom of sorts, but both leads were great in it, it was a good watch.
- Finished [God of War](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA08330_00-GOWRAGNAROK00000): well kinda, still need to kill the Valkyrie Queen and the Berserker King, but I got a little distracted by Zelda so I’ll do it later. This was great fun, the story was good, and there’s nothing more cathartic than cleaving monsters in half with a big fuck off axe 🤷‍♀️
- [Suits](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701/): wanted some easy background TV, and this fit the bill. It was most fun at the start, and then it jumped the shark a couple of times.
- [Nothing drains you like mixed emotions](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/01/psychology-of-mixed-emotions-feelings-meaning-examples/672758/) by Arthur C. Brooks
- [Smiling to death: the hidden dangers of being ‘nice’](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/its-not-you-its-the-world/202304/smiling-to-death-the-hidden-dangers-of-being-nice) by Joanna Cheek
- [How this woman creates God of War’s sound effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFVLWo5B81w) - WIRED
- [The Royal Tenembaums](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/): this is Jonathan’s fave and I hadn’t seen it, so we watched it together, it was a really fun watch 💛
- [Make love not war: talking with the creator of the first software easter egg](https://www.acriticalhit.com/make-love-not-war-first-software-easter-egg/) by “Critical Kate" Willaert
- [Horizon Forbidden West: Burning shores](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01521_00-BURNINGSHORESPS5): I freaking love horizon, so any excuse to play more is a treat, plus we got 🌈 GAY ALOY 🌈
