## âœ¨ Highlights

- Started the month in London, and when I went to get the train back I discovered there were strikes, so I had an eventful journey home on the coach ðŸ˜…
- Had an initial assessment with a dog trainer, which left me feeling hopeful about the future with Juno - heâ€™s very nervous and that makes things hard.
- I took Juno to a secure field for the first time, it was so lovely to just play with him while he ran free, without having to stress about anything.
- Went back to London, worked in the office for a couple of days and went to State of the Browser, so got to hang out with lovely work and web friends âœ¨

## ðŸŽ® Played/Read/Watched

- [The unbearable weight of massive talent](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11291274/): wanted something easy to watch, and this fit the bill, plus Pedro Pascal is always a treat to watch.
- [Wild tales](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3011894/): I was after something fun, so I rewatched this, itâ€™s so good.
- [Causeway](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10192406/): this was short and sweet, and Brian Tyree Henry was great as usual.
- [On the count of three](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11160650/): this was original and touching and funny, would highly recommend a watch!
- [Why We Donâ€™t Recommend Ring Cameras](https://www.wired.com/story/why-we-do-not-recommend-ring/) by Adrienne So
- [Jedi Survivor](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0006-PPSA07784_00-APPLEJACKGAME000): started this cause I havenâ€™t really been playing much lately, havenâ€™t made it very far, but itâ€™s been good so far.
- [Melancholia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1527186/): this was on my list, so when it came up at my local cinema, I went to see it. It was interesting and different, I enjoyed it.
- [Last night in soho](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9639470/): this was an entertaining watch, it jumped the shark a little, but the story was interesting.
- [Dumb money](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13957560/): whenever I go to London for work, I try and make some time to go to the cinema at the Barbican (best building in London!). This was a fun watch, I remember the whole Gamestop / Robin Hood situation happening, but I wasnâ€™t super clued up on the details.
- [Everybodyâ€™s talking about Jamie](https://everybodystalkingaboutjamie.co.uk/): my friend Nisha invited me to come see this play and it was SO GOOD! Everyone was super talented, and the story was really sweet.
