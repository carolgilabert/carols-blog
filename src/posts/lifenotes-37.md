## âœ¨ Highlights

- I went to Copenhagen at the beginning of the month. It had been on my list for a while, and it didn't disappoint! I had a lovely time, and here are my recs:
    - Logistics pick: (i know, i know)
        - If youâ€™re a museum babe and a public transport babe like me Iâ€™d highly recommend the [copenhagen card](https://copenhagencard.com/). I got the 72h one for Â£99 - it covers all public transport and a lot of attractions, including all the museums, canal boat tours, castles, et al. One the biggest perks in my book was not having to learn / care about transport zones and fares, I just looked up the journey on maps and hopped on the train / bus / metro.
    - Food picks:
        - [Gro Spiseri](https://www.grospiseri.dk/) â†’ this is a communal table in a greenhouse in a rooftop urban farm. They only use organic Danish produce, and the food was divine!
        - [Juno the bakery](http://www.junothebakery.com/) â†’ I went cause it was well recommended and cause my dog is called Juno and - wow - their cardamom bun was life changing.
        - [Pate pate](https://www.patepate.dk/?lang=en) â†’ in the meat packing district, good wine and really tasty food.
    -   Attraction picks:
        - [Design museum](https://designmuseum.dk/en/) â†’ I love design museums and this one was no exception! I particularly enjoyed the [Future is Present exhibition](https://designmuseum.dk/en/exhibition/the-future-is-present/) - it even had a lampshade made of cow intestines - and it was cute, 10/10 would hang in my home.
        - [Copenhagen contemporary](https://copenhagencontemporary.org/en/) â†’ I made it there half an hour before it shut, but I still got to have a glimpse at some very cool exhibitions, including a giant video wall and the guardian angels exhibit.
        - [Glyptoteket](https://www.glyptoteket.com/) â†’ the collection is great, but the building itself is incredible.
        - [Botanical gardens](https://snm.ku.dk/english/botanical-garden/) â†’ I like plants, that is all.
- Hereâ€™s [the full itinerary I did](https://wanderlog.com/view/wzgpwwiqfw/trip-to-copenhagen/shared) and I already have a couple of things earmarked for next time:
    - [Louisiana museum of modern art](https://louisiana.dk/en/) â†’ I only spotted this in my 3rd day and itâ€™s a bit far from the city, so it would have been a tight fit.
    - [MalmÃ¶](https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/malmo/) â†’ I did go over for a couple of hours, but I wish Iâ€™d gone for a day trip instead, itâ€™s cute city! Maybe next time Iâ€™ll get to the museum of disgusting foods.
- Had another work Christmas party, this time for the operations collective. It was great fun, and I won second place on the best dressed competition! (I dressed like a Christmas tree ðŸŽ„)
- Went to Italy with my family for Christmas, which was really nice. We spent a few days in Peio skiing, and then went down to Riccione to spend Christmas with my brother in law's family.
	- Learning to ski was really fun, and I LOVED going for a walk at night while we were in the Alps, you could see so many stars ðŸŒ 
	- My sister's birthday is on Christmas day, so it was nice to be with her for her 40th!
- After Christmas we all came to Nottingham and spent a few days in my apartment (all 6 of us + Juno!). It was nice to have a few more relaxed days, and I went to do a VR escape room with Bruno which was fun.
- Had a very lovely chilled out New Year's Eve with my friend Alan and Juno ðŸ¥‚

## ðŸŽ® Played/Read/Watched

- [Happy place](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/happy-place-pre-order-the-new-book-from-the-tiktok-sensation-and-sunday-times-bestselling-author-of-beach-read-and-book-lovers-emily-henry/7224549?ean=9780241609460): my friend Emma recommended this, and it was a great holiday read, an easy and enjoyable romance.
- [Chants of senaar](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Chants-of-Sennaar-2370366.html): my friend Sophie recommended this game, and it's so interesting! I didn't get super far cause I've not been picking up my Switch much recently, but the concept of it is excellent, you essentially explore the map and slowly learn the language they speak from symbols.
- [Cleopatra and frankenstein](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/cleopatra-and-frankenstein-coco-mellors/6190438?ean=9780008421793): another fun romance novel. It's a bit dark, but I think that made it more relatable.
- [The Perfectionist's guide to losing control](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-perfectionist-s-guide-to-losing-control-katherine-morgan-schafler/7123948?ean=9781398700208): this is a really interesting book. I definitely knew I had perfectionist tendencies, but I never saw myself as the stereotypical perfectionist I had in mind. But it turns out there are different types! This book goes a bit manifest-y in places, but it's interesting and worth a read I think.
- [Renaissance: A Film by BeyoncÃ©](https://imdb.com/title/tt29354040): I tend to walk tonnes when I go on holiday, so I took one evening to sit down and watch this at the cinema in Copenhagen, and it's so good! It was great to relive the concert and see a supercut of the best outfits (without the Edinburgh rain!).
- [That ADHD Story](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p0gjkq2m?partner=uk.co.bbc&origin=share-mobile): my friend Mark recommended this podcast (cause we're ADHD pals!), was a good listen.
- [Bacurau](https://imdb.com/title/tt2762506): this was a good watch, I particularly enjoyed the southern (Brazilian) people being very on brand (I'm from the south btw, I can say that) and getting immediately shot (spoilers!).
- [Mario: The Infamous History of Level 5-2](https://youtu.be/udQ_XUJt34M?si=iuhWtWALXsyDCGid)
- [The History of Super Mario Bros 3 100% World Records](https://youtu.be/_EsFyogVvkw?si=dRCodMAhkoWU20zW)
- [Rare exports](https://imdb.com/title/tt1401143): when my family was at mine after Christmas we were looking for a Christmas film so I recommended we watched this one, I enjoyed it obvs, but both my nephews did too, so a win all around.
- [It's Not You, It's Them...But It Might Be You with LalalaLetMeExplain - Is Porn Making Men Bad in Bed?](https://overcast.fm/+BCcwT55aso)
- [Off Menu with Ed Gamble and James Acaster - Ep 215: Paul Rudd](https://overcast.fm/+2IJ8afZKw)
- [The Adam Buxton Podcast - Ep.216 - Joe Lycett](https://overcast.fm/+FUW3E1oag)
