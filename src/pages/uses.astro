    alt="My desk, a bamboo top with a 27 inch monitor, and a laptop on a white laptop stand. You can also see on the desk a notepad, a pink pencil cup, a stream deck, a wireless phone charger, a coffee mug on top of a yellow coaster. Attached to the desk are a big rectangular keylight and a microphone on a boom arm. "

  <p>
    It's a bit bland, to be honest, but I'm looking to buy a house soon so I'm
    hoping to get a bit more creative with my workspace once I've moved.

  <h2>üñ• Hardware</h2>
  <p>
    My chair is a <a
      href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_gb/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/"
      >Herman Miller Aeron</a
    > and my desk is a <a
      href="https://www.fully.com/en-gb/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html"
      >Fully Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk</a
    >. Getting a standing desk after a year of working remotely was an absolute
    game changer, I'm so happy with it! I also have an <a
      href="https://www.fully.com/accessories/standing-desk-mats/muvmat-by-aeris.html"
      >anti-fatigue mat</a
    > that I got with my desk and it really helps me stand for longer üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  </p>

  <p>
    I spend most of my time on my <a

      >2021 16" MacBook Pro</a
    >. I generally use it open and my current monitor stand is a wooden one from <a
      href="https://cottonon.com/UK/typo-home/">Typo</a
    >. I've now ditched the superultrawide lifestyle, and my current monitor is

      >Apple Studio Display</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>As it turns out I have a bunch of accessories üòÖ</p>

  <p>
    For pointing, I tend to switch between an <a

      >Logitech MX Master 3 for Mac</a
    > cause it helps keep my RSI in check.
  </p>

  <p>
    For calls, I'm using my monitor's built in camera (despite the ü•î quality)
    and I have a <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light"
      >Elgato Key Light</a
    > to help with lighting. Audio wise I use my <a

    </a> and an <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/wave-3">Elgato Wave 3</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I used to run <a href="https://www.technottingham.com">Tech Nottingham</a> online
    events from here, so I have an <a

    I have a couple more bits and bobs on my desk, like a <a

      their slanted profile, it was difficult to use them in different places.

      profile keycap set, so they're easier to move around.</em

  <h3>Keychron K8</h3>
  <p>
    I got this one from work and it's a great keyboard! It's got multi channel
    bluetooth and pretty nice backlighting, I've been using it quite a lot.

  <h2>üíæ Software</h2>
  &nbsp;
  <h3>Editor</h3>

  <Image

    alt="A screenshot of VSCode, the theme is purple with yellow, pink and red fonts in places. The font is a modern looking monospace."
    widths={[600, 900]}
    sizes="(max-width: 600px) 600px, 900px"
  />

  <p>
    I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> for <strong
      >everything</strong
    >! My current theme is <a
      href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cybersamurai.midnight-purple-2077"
      >Midnight Purple 2077</a
    > and the font is <a href="https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono"
      >Dank Mono</a
    >. I have a bunch of extensions, these are my faves:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow"
        >Indent rainbow</a
      >: makes your indents pretty, and more importantly, highlights when your
      indent level isn't quite right.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webhint.vscode-webhint"
        >WebHint</a
      > + <a

        >Error Lens</a
      >: a killer combo that gives you instant feedback on the web code you
      write.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens"
        >GitLens</a
      >: super useful to get context on when the line was last changed; the
      commit message helps understand the intent and the name helps you figure
      out who to ask about it üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
    </li>
    <li>
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nhoizey.gremlins"
        >Gremlins tracker</a
      >: this is useful to find "non standard" characters when you're debugging
      a weird issue.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kamikillerto.vscode-colorize"
      >
        Colorize</a
      >: this extension shows the colour of the hex / rgb code you're using
      directly on the file.

        >Multiple cursor case preserve</a
      >: I use Cmd + D a lot to replace words / variables, and this extension
      lets me do that respecting the case of each instance.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Terminal</h3>

  <Image
    src={warp}
    alt="A screenshot of warp, the theme is dark blue, and you can see some ascii art of oh my zsh."
    widths={[600, 900]}
    sizes="(max-width: 600px) 600px, 900px"
  />

  <p>
    I use the integrated terminal on VSCode most of the time, but when I'm not
    doing repo specific stuff, I use <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For my shell I use ZSH with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">Oh My Zsh</a>, as it
    has a bunch of plugins and useful aliases out of the box.
  </p>

  <p>
    I try to keep it light on the plugins since they can slow down startup a
    bunch, but I find these two really helpful:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting"
        >ZSH Syntax Highlighting</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions"
        >ZSH Autosuggestions</a
      >
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Apps</h3>
  <p>
    There's a bunch of apps I use regularly, but the ones I always install first
    in a fresh machine are <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, <a
      href="https://magnet.crowdcafe.com">Magnet</a
    > and <a href="https://handmirror.app/">Hand Mirror</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I write things in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and I organise
    my life using <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    And here are a few apps that I use less often, but are really good at what
    they do:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12"
        >Amphetamine</a
      >
