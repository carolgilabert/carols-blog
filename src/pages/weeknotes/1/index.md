I've been meaning to start writing weeknotes for a while now. A week off seemed like a good place to start 🙂  
So here's a breakdown of what I...

## Did

- Spent this whole week with Thom in a cottage in the middle of Craik Forest, in Scotland.
- Went on loads of walks with Thom and Merlot (our host's dog).
- We visited a few places in the week: Hawick, Moffat, St Mary's Loch, and the Talla and Megget Reservoirs.
- Cooked lovely food.
- Drank wine by the fire.
- Practiced some drawing.
- Bought the [cosiest socks](https://www.seasaltcornwall.co.uk/accessories/socks-tights/chunky-knit-socks-with-fluffy-lining-aspect-berry.htm) ahead of the winter 🧦
