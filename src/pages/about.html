<h1>About me</h1>

<section>
  <p>
    Hey there! My name is Carol, and I&apos;m a (mostly) frontend software engineer. I
    currently work for <a href="http://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>. I&apos;m also an
    organiser at <a href="https://www.technottingham.com/wit-notts">Women in Tech Nottingham</a>. In my
    spare time I like to read, watch films, play videogames, make things, and learn new skills. I have a dog, Juno, a
    fluffy black German Shepherd who's very nervous ðŸ–¤
