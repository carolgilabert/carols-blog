    Hey there! My name is Carol, and I&apos;m a frontend software engineer. I
    currently work for <a href="http://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>. I&apos;m also an
    organiser at
    <a href="https://www.technottingham.com/">Tech Nottingham</a> and
    <a href="https://www.technottingham.com/wit-notts">Women in Tech</a>. In my
    spare time I like to play videogames, learn new things and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLADM3QMPk8">play capoeira</a>.
