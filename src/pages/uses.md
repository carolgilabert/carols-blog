# Uses

I've been in search of the perfect setup at home for a little while now. This is where I'm at right now:

{% Image "src/images/uses/desk.jpg", "My desk, a bamboo top with a 49 inch ultrawide monitor, a couple of pastel colour mechanical keyboards, cute teal speakers, and plenty other cute and pastel accessories.", "(max-width: 600px) 600w, 900w" %}

## üñ• Hardware

My chair is a [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_gb/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) and my desk is a [Fully Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk](https://www.fully.com/en-gb/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html). Getting a standing desk after a year of working remotely was an absolute game changer, I'm so happy with it! I also have an [anti-fatigue mat](https://www.fully.com/accessories/standing-desk-mats/muvmat-by-aeris.html) that I got with my desk and it really helps me stand for longer üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I spend most of my time on my [2021 16" MacBook Pro](https://www.johnlewis.com/2021-apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-m1-max-processor-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd/p5828283). I generally keep it shut on a [vertical laptop stand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07BV91YFL/) together with my work laptop and I drive both on my [Samsung Odyssey CRG9 49" Superultrawide Monitor](https://www.samsung.com/uk/monitors/gaming/odyssey-crg9-49-inch-120hz-freesync-curved-lc49rg90ssrxxu/).

I ended up putting my monitor on an [Ergotron HX Desk Monitor Arm](https://www.ergotron.com/en-gb/products/product-details/45-475#?color=white&buynow=0) to free up a bunch of desk space.

As it turns out I have a bunch of accessories üòÖ

For pointing, I tend to switch between an [Apple Magic Trackpad 2](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MJ2R2Z/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver) and a [Logitech MX Master 3 for Max](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/mice/mx-master-3-mac-wireless-mouse.html) cause it helps keep my RSI in check.

My webcam is a [Logitech StreamCam](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/webcams/streamcam.html) and I have a [Elgato Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light) to help with lighting.

For listening to music I use some [Kanto Yu2 speakers](https://www.kantoaudio.com/powered-speakers/yu2/) and for calls I use an [Elgato Wave 3](https://www.elgato.com/en/wave-3) and my [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-pro/).

I run [Tech Nottingham](https://www.technottingham.com) online events from here occasionally, so I also have an [Elgato StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) and an [Elgato Collapsible Green Screen](https://www.elgato.com/en/green-screen); they're super helpful for those.

I have a couple more bits and bobs on my desk, like a [wireless charger](https://www.o2.co.uk/shop/anker/power-wave-10w-dual-pad-wireless-charger), a [rotating pen cup](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/872177169/rotatable-pen-holder-funny-pen-holder?ref=yr_purchases) and a cute [pastel terrazzo coaster](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/993496645/terrazzo-coasters-pastel-confetti-switch).

As for portable stuff, I have an [iPhone 13 Pro Max](https://www.johnlewis.com/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-ios-6-7-inch-5g-sim-free-128gb/p5756469), an [Apple Watch Series 6](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-watch-series-6/), and an [12.9" M1 iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro) which I love ‚ú®

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboards

I got my first mechanical keyboard a couple of years ago, and I just fell in love with them üíõ

Here's some deets on the ones I have so far üëÄ

### WASD v3

- Board: [WASD v3](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/wasd-v3-88-key-iso-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html)
- Switches: [Cherry MX Clear](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-clear.html)
- Cable: Rose Pink Sleeved (ordered with the keyboard)
- Keycaps: I made the layout myself, you can <a href="/baby-keyboard.svg" download>get it here.</a>

_Note: Some of the letters have started to rub off._

{% Image "src/images/uses/wasd.jpg", "A white mechanical keyboard, with white, pink, and dark grey keycaps. The font on the keycaps is curly and italic. A bunch of the keys have space themed icons.", "(max-width: 600px) 600w, 900w" %}

### Ergodox EZ

- Board: [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/)
- Switches: ~~[Kaihl Copper](https://mechbox.co.uk/products/kailh-speed-copper-switch?variant=11093261090858)~~ [Banana Splits](https://www.keycrox.co.uk/product/banana-split-switches)
- Cable: [The Curled One (Cream Fuchsia Diamonds) - Clark Kable](https://clarkkable.com/)
- Keycaps: [Astrolokeys](https://astrolokeys.com/)

{% Image "src/images/uses/ergodox.jpg", "A white mechanical keyboard, split in two, with white, pink, yellow and purple keycaps in an astrological theme.", "(max-width: 600px) 600w, 900w" %}

### DZ60RGB

- Case: [Tofu Frosted Acrylic 60%](https://kbdfans.com/collections/60-layout-case/products/tofu-acrylic-frosted-60-case)
- Plate: [DZ60 CNC Aluminium Plate](https://kbdfans.com/products/dz60-cnc-aluminum-plate)
- Stabs: [Cherry PCB Stabilisers](https://kbdfans.com/products/cherry-original-pcb-stabilizers)
- Switches: [Kailh Box Navy](https://kbdfans.com/products/switch-68-cherry-gateron-zealio-2?variant=33959243088011)
- PCB: [DZ60RGB v2 Hot Swap PCB](https://kbdfans.com/products/dz60rgb-hot-swap-custom-keyboard-pcb)
- Keycaps: [Rainbow Side Printed Keycaps](https://www.millennialengineers.com/products/rainbow-side-printed-keycaps)

_Note: The keycaps didn't perfectly match the PCB layout, and because of their slanted profile, it was difficult to use them in different places. In future, I'd probably either try to match the layouts or get a DSA profile keycap set, so they're easier to move around._

{% Image "src/images/uses/tofu.jpg", "A compact 60% mechanical keyboard, with a transparent acrylic case, and rainbow side printed keycaps.", "(max-width: 600px) 600w, 900w" %}

## üíæ Software
&nbsp;
### Editor

{% Image "src/images/uses/vscode.png", "A screenshot of VSCode, the theme is purple with yellow, pink and red fonts in places. The font is a modern looking monospace.", "(max-width: 600px) 600w, 900w" %}

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for **everything**! My theme is [Nebula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChirtleLovesDolls.nebula-theme) and the font is [Latin Modern Mono](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/latin-modern-mono). I have a bunch of extensions, these are my faves:

- [Indent rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow): makes your indents pretty, and more importantly, highlights when your indent level isn't quite right.
- [WebHint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webhint.vscode-webhint) + [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens): a killer combo that gives you instant feedback on the web code you write.
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): super useful to get context on when the line was last changed; the commit message helps understand the intent and the name helps you figure out who to ask about it üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- [Read time](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.read-time): I like including read time on my blog posts, so it's helpful to have it right in VS Code.
- [Glitch](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glitch.glitch): if you use Glitch for little projects, this lets you edit your remote Glitches from your local editor ‚ú®
- [Gremlins tracker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nhoizey.gremlins): this is useful to find "non standard" characters when you're debugging a weird issue.

### Terminal

{% Image "src/images/uses/iterm.png", "A screenshot of iTerm2, the theme is dark blue, and the prompt is a random emoji, followed by folder and git indicators, and followed by a colourful chevron.", "(max-width: 600px) 600w, 900w" %}

I use the integrated terminal on VSCode most of the time, but when I'm not doing repo specific stuff, I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). My theme is called [Galaxy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/master/schemes/Galaxy.itermcolors) and I use [Latin Modern Mono](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/latin-modern-mono) here too.

For my shell I use ZSH with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), as it has a bunch of plugins and useful aliases out of the box. My shell theme is  called [miloshadzic](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/miloshadzic.zsh-theme).

I try to keep it light on the plugins since they can slow down startup a bunch, but I find these two really helpful:

- [ZSH Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
- [ZSH Autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)

### Apps

There's a bunch of apps I use regularly, but the ones I always install first in a fresh machine are [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com) and [Hand Mirror](https://handmirror.app/).

I write and organise everything in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

I use [Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy) to share keyboard and mice across devices.

And I regularly use quite a few apps from [Setapp](https://setapp.com/). If you use a Mac I'd highly recommend it, [here's my referral link](https://go.setapp.com/invite/0zefecs6) üòå

These are my faves:

- [Session](https://www.stayinsession.com/)
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)
- [Sizzy](https://sizzy.app/)
- [Downie](https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/)
- [Permute](https://software.charliemonroe.net/permute/)
- [iStatMenus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/)
- [Cleanshot X](https://cleanshot.com/)
