- I finished up my time at Capital One, and I’m sure gonna miss my friends from there 🥺
- Had a week off in between jobs, so went to London for a few days 😌
- Went to CityJS Conf! A real conf in real life with real humans! It was great fun 🎉
- Started my new job at Monzo! It’s already been really fun to learn a bunch of new things 🤓
