- Found a flat that I liked and signed a lease on it! üéâ

## üéÆ Played/Read/Watched

- [Shiva baby](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11317142/): this was such a good watch! It kept a level of tension going the whole time, really fun film.
- [Bottle rocket](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115734/): they showed some of Wes Anderson‚Äôs back catalogue at my local indie cinema, so Jonathan and I went to see this one, it was good!
