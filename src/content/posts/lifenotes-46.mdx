## ‚ú® Highlights
- I went on an excellent trip to the US with my friends Nisha and Rachael. We spent 2 a half weeks between New York, Chicago and New Orleans, and we had a lovely time! (despite the hurricane üå™Ô∏è) Some highlights from that:
  - I went to the Guggenheim in New York and it just so happens that their exhibition was from an artist I really like - Jenny Holzer - so that was nice. I also did the [99 percent invisible audio tour](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/audio-guide-to-the-imperfections-of-a-perfect-masterpiece/) and that was excellent.
  - Chicago is a truly stunning city, and I particularly enjoyed the [architecture boat tour](https://www.architecture.org/city-tours/river-cruise), [this exhibition we saw at the Chicago Cultural Center](https://greatideasofhumanity.com/), and the italian beef I had at [Mr. Beef](https://www.theoriginalmrbeef.com/) (yes, I waived my veggie-ness for that).
  - In New Orleans we ended up having to spend a couple of days holed up in our apartment because of a hurricane (!!) but thankfully when it hit land it slowed down into a tropical storm. I still managed to eat my body weight in beignets while I was there, and see some lovely jazz at [The Spotted Cat](https://www.spottedcatmusicclub.com/) and the [Preservation Hall Jazz Band](https://www.preservationhalljazzband.com/), the latter in their temporary premises sadly.
- Thom told me he can‚Äôt share custody of Juno anymore, so I need to get ready to become a single dog parent üòÖ
- Went to see Jamie XX with my friend Hayden and it was **such a good gig**! I danced so much.
- Went to the exhibition launch at Nottingham Contemporary, for their [new Donald Rodney exhibition](https://www.nottinghamcontemporary.org/whats-on/donald-rodney-visceral-canker/), which is really good.
- Whenever I get breakfast with my friend Alan at Wired, I always say I could eat another cob, so the other day he challenged me to actually do it, and I‚Äôm happy to say I succeeded üí™üèº 2 veggie sausage and special eggs cobs is my current PB.

## üéÆ Played/Read/Watched
* [Terminator](https://letterboxd.com/tmdb/218): I wanted something a bit mindless to watch on the plane, and I‚Äôd never seen Terminator, so I gave it a watch and it was a really fun film!
* [American Fiction](https://letterboxd.com/tmdb/1056360): I looooved this one. I‚Äôd been recommended it by a few friends, and they were very correct.
* [Song of Achilles](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-song-of-achilles-madeline-miller/4757280?ean=9781408891384) by Madeline Miller: I really enjoyed Circe so I picked this one up and it‚Äôs also very good! Am finding I quite enjoy historical fiction.
* [The Stepdaughter](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-stepdaughter-caroline-blackwood/7669697?ean=9780349019468) by Caroline Blackwood: This one was a recommendation by the lovely bookseller in [192 books in New York](http://www.192books.com/), and it was a great read.
* [Shrinking](https://imdb.com/title/tt15677150): I‚Äôd been wanting to rewatch Shrinking, and the whole hurricane sheltering business gave us plenty of time to do that. My friends loved it, and I enjoyed revisiting it.

* [Homecoming: a film by Beyonc√©](https://letterboxd.com/tmdb/593691):  Honestly, I rewatch this at least once a year, it‚Äôs so good.

* [Drive away dolls](https://letterboxd.com/tmdb/957304): Another flight film, it was a fun watch and Margaret Qualley is always a treat.
* [Fremont](https://letterboxd.com/tmdb/1048522): A really lovely film, full of emotion and warmth.
