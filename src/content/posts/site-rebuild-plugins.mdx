This part should be super speedy! There were a couple of plugins I wanted to get added early on, so I'm getting them in now:

## RSS

This one was very straightforward, straight from [the docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/) onto the site 😄

In future, as I add more IndieWeb functionality and therefore different types of content, I might split feeds, but for now, a simple one will do 🙌🏼

## Code highlighting

This one wasn't necessarily hard, but it had a bit more ✨ spice ✨ to it 😄

Again, I used the 11ty plugin listed on [their docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/) with all the default settings, so hooking it up was a breeze!

For the theme, I decided to go for a [PrismJS adaptation](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/blob/master/themes/prism-night-owl.css) of [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl), by [Sarah Drasner](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com) ✨ It wasn't CDN hosted, so I pulled the file and included it in my site.

This is my first CSS file, so I ended up adding a hatch into my base page layout that makes it really easy for me to include CSS and JS files only on the pages that need them. I got it from [Evan](https://darthmall.net) over at the [Piccalilli Discord](https://piccalil.li/membership/) 🙌🏼

Here's the code I added to the base layout:

```liquid
{% for script in extraScripts %}
    <script src="{{ script | url }}></script>
{% endfor %}

{% for stylesheet in extraStyles %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ stylesheet | url }}" />
{% endfor %}
```

Then I added this to the blog post layout:

```yaml
extraStyles:
  - /styles/code.css
```

And done! Said it was gonna be quick 💨
