## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched

- [This is going to hurt](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8681148/): this was a great show, but not gonna lie, it was kinda depressing.
- [Top boy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830379/): I’d started watching this a few years ago and sort of trailed off
- [Chelsea Handler: Revolution](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23711530/): it was ok, she’s pretty funny at times, but her humour is not super up my street.
- [Broker](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13056052/): this was so beautiful, totally made me cry a little at the cinema 😭
- [Abbott Elementary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14218830/) series 2: this was a really fun series, I really enjoyed it.
- [Why do we stop exploring new music as we get older?](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-26/why-do-we-stop-exploring-music-as-we-age/102006492) by Timothy McKenry
- [Nimic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10651850/): watched this short on Mubi, cause I quite like Yorgos Lanthimos, it was cool and unsettling.

  alt="Collage of pictures from March: Juno, my black german shepherd, lying on top of me on the sofa, he's staring up directly at the camera with a toy in his mouth; my friend Huai smiling and making a peace sign with his hand; a picture of me, sat at a restaurant, looking slightly awkwardly at the camera and wearing a dark green knit jumper; a cocktail, mostly transparent served on a tumbler with a salt rim and a big square ice cube; baby Juno curled up on the blue dog bed in my office; a rock band on stage, you can see the vocalist and guitarist; a plate of incredible looking pancakes, topped with bananas, caramel, pecans and a dollop of mascarpone; me standing awkwardly next to my driving instructors car holding my pass certificate; Lex speaking at Frontend Sheff, she's at the front of a room and her slide has some pictures of her."
