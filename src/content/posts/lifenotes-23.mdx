## ðŸŽ® Played/Read/Watched

- [The Anxious Person's Guide to Non-Monogamy](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-anxious-person-s-guide-to-non-monogamy-your-guide-to-open-relationships-polyamory-and-letting-go/9781839972133): this was a really approachable and pragmatic read about the realities of non-monogamy.
- [Uncharted 2](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA02344_00-UNCHARTEDTRILOGY)
- [Uncharted 3](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA02344_00-UNCHARTEDTRILOGY)
- [The Banshees of Inisherin](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11813216/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0): I really enjoyed this, but from the trailer I got mostly comedy vibes, and I found the actual film mostly sad. Was still really good, though.
- [Uncharted 4](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA00917_00-U4UTLLBUNDLE0000): after playing 1, 2 and 3, which were largely the same, 4 felt really new and fun, I enjoyed it!
- [Portrait of a Lady on Fire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8613070/): had been on my list for a while, was a great watch.
- [Deathloop](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000): I was drawn to this because the premise seems really cool, but I found the complexity ramp up a bit steep, it feels like a lot all at once. But weâ€™ll persist.
- [Decision to Leave](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12477480/): I saw the trailer for this last month and decided to catch it when it premiered. It was really good, would highly recommend it.
