## ✨ Highlights

- Monzo gave everyone the jubilee week off (Jubileave 🌴) so I went down to Devon with Juno to see my family for a few days 💛
- Signed Juno up for a dog class, and it’s been great. He’s ok with commands but gets super distracted near other dogs, so it was good to practice that.
- My friend Mark came to visit for a weekend ☺️
- Took Juno to doggy daycare for the first time and he had a blast!
- Went for yoga and brunch with Anna and it was sooo lovely 🧘🏼‍♀️
- Monzo had a summer event for everyone in the company, it was a lot of fun to hang out with work friends in person 🎉 (incidentally, I need to up my limbo game)

## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched

- [Nothing to hide](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7489816/): watched this with my sister, it was a fun watch!

- [Are You Suffering from Toxic Productivity?](https://paperform.co/blog/toxic-productivity/) by Kat Boogaard
- [Face Off](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094/): I’d never seen this one, so I watched it with a friend and it was so goofy! A fun watch, but hard to take seriously at all 😅
- [Derry Girls](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7120662/) Series 3: this is such a fun show, I’m sad it’s over!
- [Business Value, Soccer Canteens, Engineer Retention, and the Bricklayer Fallacy](https://zwischenzugs.com/2022/05/29/business-value-management-autonomy-and-engineer-retention/) by Ian Miell

- [Kenobi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8466564/): I enjoyed it cause it’s Star Wars but there wasn’t much jeopardy in the plot, cause you know where the characters end up 🤷🏼‍♀️ (getting glimpses of Vader at peak Vader is always fun, though)
- [Boy parts](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/boy-parts/9781910312636): this was a page turner for me, a slightly uncomfortable story well told.
