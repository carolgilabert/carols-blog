## ✨ Highlights
- Went on a lovely day trip to Sheffield with my friend Alan
  - We went record shopping, to the cinema, had delicious food, just a lovely time 💛
- Went to London a couple of times for work
  - On one of those trips I went climbing with my friend Hayden, which was a lot of fun! I hadn’t tried it before, and it was great to have someone to help me figure out how things work a little bit. Although, my nails were a bit too long so they didn’t fit in some of the holds properly 🙈
- Went to my friend Hugh’s 40th birthday party, got to see him and a lot of my friends, which was lovely 💛
- Decided to go on a nice walk to exercise a bit, miscalculated, ended up walking for two and a half hours with no food and no prep 👍🏼
- Went camping with my family by the Forest of Dean for a weekend. It was a really lovely place, and Juno did very well sleeping in the tent with me.
- Got a last minute haircut and dyed my hair lavender-y before my US trip.

## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched
* [Challengers](https://imdb.com/title/tt16426418): I enjoyed this, BUT, I was assembling a sewing pattern while watching it so I don’t think I gave it the attention it deserves. I think I need to watch it again properly.
* [Dead man’s shoes](https://imdb.com/title/tt0419677): I saw this in Sheffield with Alan, and I loved it so much! This is such a good film, cannot recommend it enough.
* [Superstore](https://imdb.com/title/tt4477976): Wanted something easy to stick in the background while I did other things, so a rewatch of this hit the spot.
* [Wild tales](https://imdb.com/title/tt3011894): convinced my pal Hayden to watch this, cause it’s a lot of fun, so we watched it ‘together’ remotely. Still such a fun watch.
* [Seinfeld](https://imdb.com/title/tt0098904): I have a friend whose opinion I respect, and who loves Seinfeld, so I’m giving it a try.
