## âœ¨ Highlights

- Juno went on holiday with Thom to Scotland for 2 weeks. It was nice to have a little bit of freedom but I missed him ðŸ¥º
- Started going to yoga more regularly and itâ€™s been really great for me.
- Went to Manchester to visit Mark. Saw a couple of museums, ate some great food.
- Did a sewing class for beginners, and had a great time! I made a cushion cover and a tote bag, and now Iâ€™m excited to make more things ðŸŽ‰
- We ran the first in person Women in Tech in a really long time! It was really lovely to see folks old and new to the community ðŸ’–
- Started learning to drive finally! Itâ€™s been a little hard, a little stressful, but also fun.
- Went on some fun dates with cute and interesting people ðŸ˜Œ

## ðŸŽ® Played/Read/Watched

- [Stranger Things](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/) Series 4 Volume 2: I really liked this series, but I didnâ€™t like that it didnâ€™t have a conclusion at all, and it will probably be a long while before they release the final series.
- [All about love](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/all-about-love-new-visions/9780060959470): this book was an excellent read, canâ€™t recommend it enough. It was tough at times, especially with where I am emotionally, but it was so worth it.
- [Russian Doll](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7520794/) Series 2: it was ok, I definitely liked the first series a lot better though.
- [Depression is probably not caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain â€“ newÂ study](https://theconversation.com/depression-is-probably-not-caused-by-a-chemical-imbalance-in-the-brain-new-study-186672) by Joanna Moncrieff and Mark Horowitz
- Ended up rewatching some [Black Mirror](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/) while at Markâ€™s. We watched San Junipero, Nosedive and Playtest. You know the drill, interesting but grim.
- Went to Broadway for a double session with [Meshes of the afternoon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036154/) and [Mulholland Drive](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166924/). Iâ€™d never seen Mulholland Drive but I do really like David Lynchâ€™s work, so I went along, and it was great!
- Rewatched both [Kill Bill Vol. 1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) and [Kill Bill Vol. 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/) with Thom on a lazy Sunday. In hindsight, not really worth rewatching ðŸ˜‚
- [Switching from Customer Service Representative to Backend Engineer](https://monzo.com/blog/2022/07/26/switching-from-customer-service-representative-to-backend-engineer) by Kyle Campbell and Duncan Roberts
- [Documenting pull requests is as important as writing good code](https://monzo.com/blog/2021/09/30/documenting-pull-requests-is-as-important-as-writing-good-code) by Duncan Roberts
- [The gray man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1649418/): perfect film for a day off sick. Lots of action and no discernible plot ðŸ˜…
- [Stray](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP2333-PPSA02101_00-STRAYSIEE0000000): Iâ€™ve been going out more this summer, which is good for my mental health, but bad for my gaming time ðŸ˜‚Â I still got this and am playing it in bits, itâ€™s a really fun and relaxing game.
- [Pride](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3169706/): queer people and union action, whatâ€™s not to love?
- [Swimming pool](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0324133/): I got back on Mubi, and this was the first film of the day. I enjoyed it, especially the ambiguity of the ending ðŸ‘€
