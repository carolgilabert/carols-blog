## ✨ Highlights

- We’re got the keys to our house on the 18th! 🎉
- I took two and a half weeks of work to move and disconnect for a bit, and it was lovely! Although, I might have disconnected a bit too much and slightly resented coming back to my status of 'cog in the capitalist machine' 😅

## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched

- [AC Valhalla](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0001-PPSA01490_00-GAME000000000000): still plodding through it 🤷🏼‍♀️
- [Jedi Fallen Order](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0006-CUSA12529_00-RESPAWNSWBIRDDOG) was great fun! Although some of the mechanics that are meant to make it harder actually just made it annoying 😅 I'm a busy woman, I can't spend my life traversing these planets, just give me fast travel!
- [The men who stared at goats](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1234548): I read the book a few months ago and it made me want to watch the film. Was alright 🤷🏼‍♀️
- This was a [great read on what's wrong with NFTs](https://everestpipkin.medium.com/but-the-environmental-issues-with-cryptoart-1128ef72e6a3).
- [Guns akimbo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6902676): wacky and fun 😄
- This [article hit hard for me](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/pandemic-goodbye-casual-friends/617839/) cause I do really miss all the folks I have more casual friendships with 😢
- [Tenet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6723592): I enjoyed it, very on brand Nolan film, had me entertained trying to anticipate the twists.
- [Maquette](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP2333-CUSA24479_00-MAQUETTESIEE0000): Had a quick go at this but it didn't really grab me, to be honest. Some aspects reminded me of superliminal, but overall was a bit meh so I ditched it.
- Finished reading [Girl, Woman, Other.](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/girl-woman-other-winner-of-the-booker-prize-2019/9780241984994) It was a great read, full of lovely stories, and I particularly enjoyed the way the stories were threaded together.
- [Parasite](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668): finally got around to watching it and it was so, so good! Just a superb film.
- [Key & Peele](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981558): started watching it from the beginning, will prob do a little bit at a time in between watching other stuff.
- [Naked gun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095705): went looking for something fun to watch and ended up watching this. Silly and fun until I realised one of the main people in it is OJ Simpson 😑
- This was a [good read with some great advice](https://laurieontech.com/posts/job-search/) on interviewing.

_We went for a walk by the river early in the month; the rest are from the move, and the generalised chaos of the situation_ 😅
