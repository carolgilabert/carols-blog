## ‚ú® Highlights

- Saw Everything Everything live at Rock City with my good friend Sam, who I hadn't seen in years! They were really great, and it was nice to catch up with Sam.
- I've been meaning to learn a bit about photography, so I got an old camera off eBay for ¬£30 to learn the basics. It's a [Canon Powershot SX120 IS](https://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/canon_powershot_sx120_is_review).
- Had a smol fire in my apartment, the thermostat in my boiler spontaneously combusted. I caught it early and shut down all the switches in the fuse box, so thankfully it wasn't much more than a big scare for Juno and I, well that and a flat full of black smoke and soot.
  - Bizarrely this is when I heard from my landlord for the first time, they sent me flowers and a card that basically said 'soz there was a fire at your flat' üòÇ
- I rejoined [Nottingham Hackspace](https://nottinghack.org.uk/), hopefully this time I'll go in more and get to know people there ü§ûüèº
  - I'm joining the space's village at EMF Camp, so hoping that's a good start!
- Started to tentatively look at houses to buy, given my lease is up in August.
- My friend Nisha invited me to go see some stand up comedy, and it was really great fun, all [the comedians on that evening](https://www.justthetonic.com/nottingham-comedy/shows/saturday-27-apr-2024/6153/) were great.
  - Two things to know:
    - Nottingham is a popular destination for stag / hen dos.
    - Comedians in small venues are savage at the crowd work.
  - You do the math.
- I'm dipping my toe into event organising again, helping to bring back [Women in Tech Nottingham](https://www.technottingham.com/events/wit-2024-may) üíõ I find it really rewarding and I've missed it dearly, and I'm so excited to meet the lovely local friends I haven't seen in a while.

## üéÆ Played/Read/Watched

- [Small Pleasures, by Clare Chambers](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/small-pleasures-longlisted-for-the-women-s-prize-for-fiction-2021-clare-chambers/4992984?ean=9781474613903): an interesting novel, I enjoyed it a lot, but the ending really caught me.
- [Nighthawks by Edward Hopper: Great Art Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKIbT-4UFaE)
- [Order from chaos, the everyday grind of staying organised with adult ADHD, by Jaclyn Paul](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/order-from-chaos-the-everyday-grind-of-staying-organized-with-adult-adhd-jaclyn-paul/1419574?ean=9780578578873): Now I've been on ADHD meds for a bit, I'm making an active effort of working out where I still struggle because of it, and how I can work with my brain instead of against it. This was a good read, and had some real gems, but a lot of the systems she shows are paper-based, so don't really work for me.
- [Monkey Man](https://imdb.com/title/tt9214772): I tried to get preview tickets for this a while back unsuccessfully so I went to see it on premiere day and I loved it so much! A really fun film, really well made, and watching interviews with Dev Patel after made me really appreciate how good it was for the budget (and all the mishaps) they had.
- [Couples therapy](https://imdb.com/title/tt10665386): my therapist recommended me this as a realistic view of what people discuss in therapy and I got SO hooked! I'd highly recommend a watch, it's great to see people working through problems, and it's very likely you'll see yourself in places. Also if you do watch it let me know cause I wanna compare notes on our 'faves'.
- [How to make an ineffective 404 page by Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.website/published/how-to-make-an-ineffective-404-page/)
- [You‚Äôre a Blogger, Not an Essayist by Barry Hess](https://bjhess.com/posts/you-re-a-blogger-not-an-essayist)
- [Seattle and the internet by Cassidy Williams](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/seattle-internet/)
- [On Self-Respect: Joan Didion‚Äôs 1961 Essay from the Pages of Vogue](https://www.vogue.com/article/joan-didion-self-respect-essay-1961): I saw a rec for this on TikTok and it's such a good read, it felt really close to home, and made me realise I'm slowly improving that side of myself with therapy üíõ
- [The Balanced Brain: The Science of Mental Health, by Camilla Nord](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-balanced-brain-camilla-nord/7376964?ean=9780241545799): I listened to the audiobook and it's so interesting! It covers the brain processes that make up your mental health, studies on the area, how antidepressants work. I don't think I'll retain the details, to be honest, but it was a fascinating listen.
- [The Thursday Murder Club, by Richard Osman](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-thursday-murder-club-the-thursday-murder-club-1-richard-osman/4937726?ean=9780241988268): I got this a while ago, and while I'm not in a mystery phase at the moment, this was a fun read, the characters are loveable and the story had some good twists and turns.
- [How to with John Wilson](https://imdb.com/title/tt10801534): I got a double rec for this and it's really good fun! Love all the small details, the visual jokes, and the weirdos in each episode.
- [The Kite Runner](https://www.thekiterunnerplay.com/): my friend Rachael invited me to come see this with her, and it was such a good play, the actors and musicians were excellent, but the story was so devastatingly sad.
- [2001: A Space Odyssey](https://imdb.com/title/tt0062622): this had been on the metaphorical list for a loooong time, so when I noticed my local Showcase was screening it I got tickets, I figured it would be worth watching on the big screen and woooow was that the right call! I absolutely loved it, and am still in awe at how beautiful it was and how impressive the effects were for the time. It's absolutely rightly considered one of the best films ever, I would highly recommend seeing it on the big screen if you can.
  - Watching it predictably sent me down a YouTube rabbit hole, so here are some of vids I watched:
    - [4 Ways 2001: A Space Odyssey Was a Visual-Effects Pioneer](https://youtu.be/5ch5WC54egU?si=RCWbrg18p5DlXfNk)

    - [2001 - A Space Odyssey: Crash Course Film Criticism #15](https://youtu.be/KEEnap_h8cs?si=oF8h773dSWDor2yb)
- I went for an eye exam, and it made me want to understand the tests they do, so I went down another YouTube rabbit hole:
  - [Eye Exam, Understanding What the Eye Doctor is Doing](https://youtu.be/Enx36m8Y6V8?si=sfLB296B3m0pVDKt)

It goes into the merits of generalism over specialism and where it can work better. I've always been curious about everything and not a specialist on anything really, so it's been nice to learn about the upsides.

- [Ac√∫stico MTV: C√°ssia Eller](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327608/): I looove C√°ssia Eller, so every few years I rewatch this show and miss her a little ü•≤
