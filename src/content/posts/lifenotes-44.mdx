## âœ¨ Highlights
- Had some fun dinners with my lovely friends ðŸ’›
- Checked out the dinosaur themed crazy golf that opened.
- Went on some fun dates.
- Ran out of ADHD meds, and boy was it rough! Itâ€™s hard to tell when brain meds are working, because well, they just work, but I can tell you I missed them immediately ðŸ˜…
- Went to Steelcon in Sheffield with my pal Mark. Despite not being a security person, I had loads of fun and met many nice people. Also it was the same day as the Crowdstrike thing, so the jokes were on point.
- I decided to take a break from therapy. I feel like I made a bunch of progress and want to spend a bit of time â€˜just livingâ€™ to see what thatâ€™s like.
- Iâ€™m managing to stick with yoga, which is very exciting.
- Went to Pride with my pal Nisha, she let me crash the firefightersâ€™ section and we had some fun watching drag shows after ðŸŒˆ

## ðŸŽ® Played/Read/Watched
* [Youâ€™re the worst](https://imdb.com/title/tt3228420): Iâ€™ve been recommending this to friends recently and itâ€™s made me rewatch it. Still makes me laugh, and still makes me cry a little.
* [The Bear](https://imdb.com/title/tt14452776) series 3: It was a good series, but I donâ€™t have much to say about it.
* [Kinds of kindness](https://letterboxd.com/tmdb/1029955): This was a really fun watch, Jesse Plemons in particular was excellent in it.
* [Why is Chile so long? - Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/why-is-chile-so-long)
* [Oldboy](https://letterboxd.com/tmdb/670): They were showing this at a local cinema, so I couldnâ€™t pass up the opportunity. It is still so good!
* [James Acaster - Cold lasagne hate myself 1999](https://imdb.com/title/tt13446472):  Iâ€™d seen a bunch of clips of this already, but it was still a fun watch.
* [Hannah Berner - We ride at dawn](https://imdb.com/title/tt31021953): Again, Iâ€™ve seen her on TikTok a bunch, so this was more of that in long form. 
* [What they don't teach you about money by Claer Barrett](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/what-they-don-t-teach-you-about-money-habits-to-get-you-unstuck-and-on-the-road-to-financial-freedom-claer-barrett/7208350?ean=9781529146332):
  * One of the main ways ADHD affects me is impulsive spending. It makes me steal from my future self and goals for an immediate dopamine hit. So I read this to inform some steps I want to take to manage that a bit better, and it's a most excellent read.
  * I listened to the audiobook version, and I can't recommend it enough. It covers a lot of ground, and does so in a clear and non-judgmental way.
* [Search party](https://imdb.com/title/tt5460226): I like the premise, I like the cast, but it fizzled out for me a bit, I watched the first series and started the second, but left it there.
* [Other people's clothes by Calla Henkel](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/other-people-s-clothes-calla-henkel/5072868?ean=9781529357677): 
  * At first I was a bit wary of the annoying protagonists, but I did really enjoy the story, and once I was about halfway through I ended up staying up late to see what happened at the end!
