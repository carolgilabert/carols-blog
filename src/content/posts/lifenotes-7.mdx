Hey friends! February was another locked down month, so not much happening beyond work and generally surviving 😅

## 😄 Good stuff

- Attended [Web Stories Conf](https://webstoriesconf.com/) and saw some great talks.
- Pancake day! 🥞
- Got my hands on a PS5 💥
- Finally ordered a Cricut and started making cute things with it.
- Relaunched my site! 🎉
- We have a moving date 🥳

## ☹️ Bad stuff

- Nothing comes to mind 😱 ( personally, of course, the world at large is still a 🗑️🔥 )

## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched

- [Great read from Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/journal/17794) on autocomplete for OTP on the web.
- This [article on dependency confusion](https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610) was a good read.
- This [article on the buzzfeed-ification of mental health](https://mentalhellth.xyz/p/the-buzzfeed-ification-of-mental) was very interesting. Not sure I agree with all of it, but it was a good exploration.
- This [article about impostor syndrome](https://hbr.org/2021/02/stop-telling-women-they-have-imposter-syndrome) is a great read. It brings a different perspective on the issue and shifts the focus onto why women suffer from it.
- Watched [Zodiac](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443706) for the first time, good film.
- There was that one Friday where we all watched the [Handforth Parish Council meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgGmYeAm0jk) and collectively lost it 😂 (I stan Jackie Weaver ✊🏼 )
- Watched [The Queen's Gambit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10048342) and absolutely loved it! The story, photography, wardrobe, actors... all great 💛
- Started watching [The Crown](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824) Series 4.
- Rewatched [The Prestige](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571), and even having seen it before, was still delighted at the twists and turns of the story. #TeamAngier
- Started playing [Super Mario 3D World](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Super-Mario-3D-World-Bowser-s-Fury-1832228.html), it's great fun!
- Started playing [Assassins Creed Valhalla](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10000237) on the PS5, and it's really pretty, but I think I hammered AC a bit too much recently, so not as enthused 😅
- Really enjoyed reading about [Ana's typical day](https://ohhelloana.blog/my-typical-day/) ☺️
- To take a break from AC, started playing [Jedi Fallen Order](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0006-CUSA12529_00-RESPAWNSWBIRDDOG), and even though it's buggy and has some weird mechanics, it's still a good Star Wars game.
