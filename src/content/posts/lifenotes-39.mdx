## âœ¨ Highlights

- I got back into crafting a bit, and made my hallway into a 'toddler art wall' with all the things I've crafted / made. The energy is the fridge door where you dutifully put up your child's ugly drawings.
- Had a loooovely spa day with my friends Rachael and Anna, I'd had a very busy few weeks at work and it ended the day before our spa day so it was just âœ¨ the best âœ¨
- Spent some time with Rachael and Nisha planning our trip to the US later this year, very exciting! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸŽ® Played/Read/Watched

- [The Holdovers](https://imdb.com/title/tt14849194): this was a really sweet film, a feel good Christmas story.
- [Bonnie and Clyde](https://imdb.com/title/tt0061418): my local cinema showed this on Valentine's day, so I went to see it cause I never had. It was a good watch, and parts of it were genuinely funny, like every time they drove off, loud aggressive banjo played, regardless of the tone of the scene ðŸ˜‚
- [Taylor Tomlinson: Have it all](https://imdb.com/title/tt30796334): I like Taylor's humour, so I enjoyed this a lot.
- [Little Fires Everywhere](https://imdb.com/title/tt8089592): I read the book a while back, and it made me wanna watch this, it was good, if a bit flat.
- [My Cousin Vinny](https://imdb.com/title/tt0104952): I was off sick one day and looking for something light and fun to watch so I watched this, Marisa Tomei is just excellent in it.
- [Hacks](https://imdb.com/title/tt11815682): got a rec for this off someone I follow on TikTok and it was really great fun, I love 30 minute comedies and this is a very good one.
- [Perfect Days](https://imdb.com/title/tt27503384): went to see this in the cinema and loved it so much! Good music, good vibes, and touching characters ðŸ’›
