Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

For a while now, Iâ€™ve been meaning to start a blog. My main aim with it is to document my learnings, but Iâ€™ll probably also ramble on about various things.

I have started-deleted-started-deleted the code for this site many times, always wanting to try something different 5 minutes after getting started. I did have things I wanted to write about though, so my ever-so-reasonable partner Thom recommended I started with something simple, and worked on it when I had the time.

So here we are: this is bare, but itâ€™s just the beginning. Stay tuned ðŸ˜‰
