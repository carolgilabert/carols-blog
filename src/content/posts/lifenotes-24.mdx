## ✨ Highlights

- Went to Brighton for FFConf and a couple of days off, and it was joyful! Was really great to hang out with lovely people, catch some sunshine, and have a little of time and space to myself 😌
- Made some time to see friends, which was lovely, cause my friends are the best 💛
- Finally started moving things to get the house on the market. Someone came round to take pictures, hopefully it will be listed soon 🤞🏼
- Didn’t really get on with the therapist I’ve been seing through my health insurance, so I’ve decided to wrap those sessions up and go looking for a private therapist that fits what I’m looking for (basically not [CBT](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/overview/)).
- Got a new piercing! I’d been wanting to get my septum done for ages, finally got off my arse and booked it in.
- Started seeing someone really great 💛

## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched

- [Great British Bake Off](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877368/): I’m really happy Syabira won, she was my fav from the start.
- Went to see [Triangle of Sadness](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/) with my good friend Kevino (if you’re reading this I’m sorry this is your name now forever). I enjoyed it, but it was a bit on the long side.
- Got proper into [Deathloop](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000) and I freaking love it now (it’s on pause while I play God of War though).
- [We spoke with the last person standing in the floppy disk business](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/we-spoke-with-the-last-person-standing-in-the-floppy-disk-business/) by Niek Hilkmann & Thomas Walskaar
- [Wtf is an island and why is it in my website?](https://rachsmith.com/wtf-is-an-island/) by Rach Smith
- [Shein is even worse than you thought](https://www.thecut.com/2022/10/shein-is-treating-workers-even-worse-than-you-thought.html) by Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz
- [The roles we play](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-roles-we-play/9781912408306): this is such a beautiful book and story 💛 I really enjoyed the detail that each chapter came with a chosen track you could listen while you read.
- [The IndieWeb for everyone](https://mxb.dev/blog/the-indieweb-for-everyone/) by Max Böck
- [God of War Ragnarök](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA08330_00-GOWRAGNAROK00000): haven’t had a lot time to get stuck into this, but it’s always satisfying when at the end of a long day you can cleave some fake creatures in half to unwind 😌
- Went to see [Black Panther: Wakanda Forever](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9114286/) with Nisha and Rachael. Not the biggest marvel fan, but it was a fun watch and it was lovely to hang out with my mates.
- Caught [Aftersun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19770238/) after seeing a trailer for it earlier in the month. It was a good watch, and emotionally compelling, but I was really sleepy when I went to see it and there were a few dark, quiet scenes 😅
