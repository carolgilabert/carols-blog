## ‚ú® Highlights

- Caught up with a few friends I don't see often over drinks üçª
- Went to see Holly Humberstone in Leicester with my friends Nisha and Rachael, I didn't really know her, but she was great live.
- My friend Rachael got us tickets to go to [Arcade](https://www.darkfield.org/arcade), an immersive audio experience. It was so goood! Would recommend it if it comes near you. It's essentially a choose your own adventure audio only game, and you're in complete darkness, so it feels really vivid. It was short, I would have totally gone back if I had time.
- Spent a few days in Bristol with my lovely sister üíõ
  - We never get to hang out just the two of us, so it was nice to mooch around Bristol, have nice food, see the sights, and we even made it to a Jazz concert / Lindy Hop taster, which was really fun.
    - Some recs from our days there:
    - [Ahh toots](https://ahhtoots.com/): excellent cakes.
    - [Farro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VxL3etLAA4D3aZwJ6): everything was tasty, but I loved the cheese scones in particular.
    - [Caf√© Cuba](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g6Kbujuj2YwhBBLF9): the food here was sooooo good! I had an avocado and tomato salad I'll be thinking about for a long time.
      - [Filthy XIII](https://filthyxiii.com/): great music and cocktails, and some good looking hot dogs I'd like to go back to try.

## üéÆ Played/Read/Watched

- [This is how you lose the time war](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war-an-epic-time-travelling-love-story-winner-of-the-hugo-and-nebula-awards-for-best-novella-amal-el-mohtar/4688219?ean=9781529405231): it had been a while since I read science fiction, and I really loved this. It's short, really creative and a great story.
- [All of us strangers](https://imdb.com/title/tt21192142): this was so good, but so sad.
- [The quiet, pervasive devaluation of frontend by Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/devaluing-frontend)
- [Dune](https://imdb.com/title/tt1160419): I rewatched this before seeing part 2, and it's very pretty, but basically nothing happens.
- [Dune part two](https://imdb.com/title/tt15239678): ok everything happens in this one üòÇ It's very well made, but it's not the kind of things that calls to me.
- [I think you should leave](https://imdb.com/title/tt10050772): a friend recommended this and I watched some, but it's not really for me I'm afraid.
- [Saturday Night Live](https://imdb.com/title/tt0072562): I started to watch some episodes from this year's season, and ended up fallng into a massive rabbit hole and watching lots of it.
- [Abbott Elementary](https://imdb.com/title/tt14218830) series 3: I love this show, and am enjoying the new series too.
- [Blackberry](https://imdb.com/title/tt21867434): this was so good! I knew Blackberry was big back in the day, but I never realised how big. Really interesting and well made.
- [The growing backlash against AI by tante](https://tante.cc/2024/03/18/5115/)
- [‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry to have to announce that my cancer situation has developed not necessarily to my advantage‚Äô by Simon Boas](https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2024/02/11/jersey-overseas-aid-director-simon-boas-discusses-his-terminal-cancer-diagnosis/)
- [Superbob](https://imdb.com/title/tt3055402): I love Brett Goldstein, so I dug out this film from a while back, and it was a really fun watch. It's funny, short, and sweet.
- [Madame Web](https://imdb.com/title/tt11057302): ok I watched this just to see if it was that bad. Yes. Yes, it is.
- [Circe](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/circe-the-no-1-bestseller-from-the-author-of-the-song-of-achilles-madeline-miller/1246443?ean=9781408890042): I'd never read a historical fiction novel before, and I really enjoyed this! It was fun to connect the bits I knew to the rich story in the book. I enjoyed the genre.
- [Broad City](https://imdb.com/title/tt2578560): I was on the market for a 30 minute comedy, and this was great! Really silly and fun, I zoomed through it all.
- [Lara Croft: Tomb Raider](https://imdb.com/title/tt0146316): I was pretty tired after work on a Friday and I fancied a fun action film so I rewatched this classic from my youth. I'd forgotten how fun it was! My 3 main takeaways:
  - It's so faithful to the games, which I played a lot growing up, so obvs I love it.
  - If I was rich, I'd probably also spend it like a rich 10 year old.
  - How did I not realise then that I was bi? Honestly baffling.
- [Lara Croft: Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life](https://imdb.com/title/tt0325703): ok I obvs had to watch the second one the next day.
- [Hello World](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/hello-world-how-to-be-human-in-the-age-of-the-machine-hannah-fry/4018651?ean=9781784163068) by Hannah Fry: I got into listening to audiobooks for my non-fiction books, so I can listen when I'm cooking, tidying up, or walking Juno. This was a good read, a nice high level overview of where algorithms do well and where they don't.
- [Hackers](https://imdb.com/title/tt0113243): how had I never seen this?! So good! Good music, good old timey computer visuals, and just generally good fun.
- [Tomb Raider I](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1875-PPSA16902_00-TOMBRAIDER123224): rewatching the films made me do my semi periodic rummage to see if anyone remastered the old games for modern consoles, and guess what?! Some fantastic humans have now, so I started to play Tomb Raider I on my PS5. Initial thoughts: movement and camera controls back then were hard, y'all! I'm hoping I'll get a good hold of the controls before I get to my fav, Tomb Raider II.
