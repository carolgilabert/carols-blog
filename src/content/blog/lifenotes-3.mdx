Hey, friends! This week has been a quiet one over here. I spent a lot of it feeling under the weather (maybe because of my flu jab) so didn't get up to much.

Hope you had a nice one ðŸ™‚

## Did

- [Tech Nottingham](https://www.technottingham.com/events/tech-nottingham-november-2020) was great, we had an awesome talk on gender bias, and played some games with the community. Turns out people love to be given an opportunity to say: "Can I have a vowel, please Carol?" ðŸ˜‚
- Saw friends and family on zoom this week, which was lovely, but contributed to my exhaustion, as I spent a pretty high proportion of my waking time on zoom this week ðŸ˜­
- So I ended up spending the rest of the time resting and recovering.
