- Finished [The Mercies](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-mercies/9781529075076), by Kiran Millwood Hargrave. I found the story a bit tepid but the setting was really interesting.
- [The seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/seven-husbands-of-evelyn-hugo-the-sunday-times-bestseller/9781398515697) by Taylor Jenkins Reid. This was a page turner for me, I devoured it over two days.
