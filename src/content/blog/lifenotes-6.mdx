Hey pals! I clearly cannot be trusted to write every week, so I'm turning my weeknotes into monthly reviews. Here are the headlines for January:

## 😄 Good stuff

- We got some snow here in Notts. It was a nice little shake up to the lockdown routine.
- I got into hand embroidery and it's great fun!
- Had a call with the mental health nurse at my GP surgery, and "aced" the ADHD triage questionnaire, so I'm being referred for a proper assessment.
- Got some good speakers for my desk, so the vibes have gone 📈 📈 📈

## ☹️ Bad stuff

- Our house buying process is dragging on, the bank is being nitpicky about documents, and everything takes an age.
- My setup has been really annoying lately. I managed to get the monitor replaced, but I'm still having some issues, so now to figure out if it's the cables or the macs.
- My routine hasn't been great, which in turn makes me feel not great.

## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched

- We whizzed through [AC Origins](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0001-CUSA05625_00-GAMEACEMPIRE0000) and are now making our way through [AC Odyssey](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0001-CUSA09303_00-GAME000000000000). I love Kassandra! She's rad, and hits on everyone, sometimes at very inappropriate times, which is hilarious 😄
- Started reading [Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/girl-woman-other-winner-of-the-booker-prize-2019/9780241984994), and I'm really enjoying it. Thanks, work secret santa 🙌🏼
- Thom told me all about the [Royal Institution's Christmas Lectures](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000qpjk/royal-institution-christmas-lectures-2020-planet-earth-a-users-guide-1-engine-earth) and we watched a couple of them. They're awesome!
- We've been mostly rewatching films instead of watching new ones. The ones we rewatched in January were [Die Hard 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099423), [Falling Down](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106856) and [The Big Short](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363) - such a great film.
