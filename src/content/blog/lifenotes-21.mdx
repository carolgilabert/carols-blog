## ✨ Highlights

- I went to Italy for a week, did a few days solo and then met up with my lovely sister and nephews. It was a lot of fun, and nice to disconnect for a bit 💛
- Had quite a few fun outings with friends. Nice meals, walks, trips to the park, just all around enjoyable days.

## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched

- [Nightbitch](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/nightbitch-stylist-s-summer-cult-breakout-9781529113990/9781529113990): this was a great read. It was an unusual story that hit a lot of relatable feelings.
- [BBC Radio 4, The Silent Mind](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0019r11): this was so interesting! I definitely have an inner monologue, but it was so fun to hear how different people’s experiences are on this.
- [Paris, 13th district](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12708658/): wasn’t super into it, but was an entertaining watch.
- [The dog who wouldn’t be quiet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13648184/): I really enjoyed this film, short, sweet and a little weird, in a nice way.
- [All the crows in the world](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14994868/): this was a fun short I saw on Mubi.
- [Prima facie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21093976/): this was a tough watch cause of the sexual assault theme, but it was really good.
- [QI Series S](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0380136/): always enjoyable, and also the reason why I now say ‘darling’ every other sentence.
- [Nope](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/): watched this in the cinema when it came out and really enjoyed it.
- [Heartstopper](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10638036/): a friend had been recommending this for ages and I finally watched it, it was so lovely and heart warming 💖
- [Convenience Store Woman](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/convenience-store-woman/9781846276842): this was a short and sweet holiday read.
- [5x2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354356/): I hated this film, a small part of the why is because I hated the husband, but mostly because of the gratuitous depictions of sexual assault that I don’t think were intended to be SA 😬
- [A thought experiment: what if we talked about the over-60s’ screen time the way we talk about young people’s screen time?](https://webdevlaw.uk/2022/08/18/a-thought-experiment-what-if-we-talked-about-the-over-60s-screen-time-the-way-we-talk-about-young-peoples-screen-time/) by Heather Burns
- [Why thinking hard wears you out](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-thinking-hard-wears-you-out/) by Diana Kwon
- [The book of form and emptiness](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-book-of-form-and-emptiness-winner-of-the-women-s-prize-for-fiction-2022/9781838855277): started this while on holiday, and I’m not very far in, but I love the way the story is told.
- [Burnout in 2022: “Am I burnt out, or is this just life now?”](https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/am-i-burnt-out/698441) by Chloe Laws
- [Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild](https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-70010000000023): picked this up again cause it turns out I hadn’t completed the trial of the sword.
