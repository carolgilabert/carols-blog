## ✨ Highlights

- [DDD East Midlands](https://www.dddeastmidlands.com/pastconferences/album/) was such good fun! And a great foray into IRL conferences again 🎉
- Went into the Monzo office for the first time 🚀
- Started attending BSL classes again, after a forced covid hiatus.
- Went to [React Advanced](https://reactadvanced.com) with my new workmates, it was great ✨
- Family came to visit for a few days 💛
- [State of the browser](https://2021.stateofthebrowser.com) was awesome. Got to meet some web twitter friends IRL and hang out ☺️
- I succumbed to the hype (and the despondency over my 2018 MBP keyboard) and got a new mac! I ended up going for the 16" M1 Max, and this thing is so silent and fast 🤩
- Caught up with a friend after a long time 💛
- Went to a Brownies STEM event and it was so much fun! 🎉
- First Homebrew back in person! 💛👩🏼‍💻
