- I went to the IVAM while I was in Valencia and saw two exhibitions I absolutely loved:
    - One was on [Zanele Muholi’s work](https://www.ivam.es/en/exposiciones/zanele-muholi/).
    - The other one was on the [design of the posters of Valencia’s clubbing scene in the 80s.](https://www.ivam.es/en/exposiciones/ruta-grafica-designs-for-the-sound-of-valencia/)
