- [Saltburn](https://imdb.com/title/tt17351924): I missed this in cinemas in December so I watched it when it came out on streaming. It was really fun, I enjoyed it.
- [The Sopranos](https://imdb.com/title/tt0141842): started watching the Sopranos with my pal Alan, it's his favourite show and I'd never seen it before. So far I'm loving it, it holds up really well after all these years too!
