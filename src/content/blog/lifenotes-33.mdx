## 🎮 Played/Read/Watched

- [The bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/) series 2: this series was as good if not better than the first! This show is definitely a highlight of recent TV for me.
- [Bad sisters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15469618/): I love Sharon Horgan so this was an easy yes for me, and the story is good.
- [Software as a Service is bad for job satisfaction](https://ericexperiment.com/post/02-11-2021-saas-is-bad-for-job-satisfaction) by Eric Mackrodt
- [Energy makes time](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/energy-makes-time/) by Mandy Brown
- [Things you forgot (or never knew) because of React](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/antiquated-react) by Josh Collinsworth
- [Modus Operandi: Césio 137](https://overcast.fm/+2Aq5ARbg0)
- [Off menu: Tim Minchin](https://overcast.fm/+2IJ9YNerY)
- [Off menu: Lily Allen](https://overcast.fm/+2IJ-dF91w)
- [Survival of the thickest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17361756/): this was a recommendation from Rachael and it was such a fun watch!
- [Tailwind and the Femininity of CSS](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/tailwind-and-the-femininity-of-css) by Elaina Natario
- [Heartstopper](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10638036/) series 2: it was cute, but I found it less engaging than series 1. I mean, I’m clearly not the target audience, so there’s that.
- [The giant mechanical man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1769363/): a sweet 90 minute rom com, with good actors and an unusual story.
- [Michelle Buteau: Welcome to Buteaupia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12509942/)
- [Grey’s Anatomy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/) series 19: still a good background show 🤷‍♀️
- [Beef](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14403178/): I really enjoyed this, it’s my kind of storytelling. And the overall message was compelling to me too: you can ‘have it all’ and still feel a hole inside you; and being known and understood is all people want.
- [Atlanta](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4288182/) series 4: another good series, the final one. I could easily watch a few more series of these characters, but I think it’s good that it was ended there.
- [How to keep house while drowning](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/how-to-keep-house-while-drowning-a-gentle-approach-to-cleaning-and-organising-kc-davis/6656775): a great book on how to approach cleaning your home in a way that works for you, instead of pushed by shame. I’d really recommend a read.
- [The favourite](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5083738/): Olivia Colman is always a treat, so I enjoyed this a lot.
- [Little fires everywhere](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/little-fires-everywhere-celeste-ng/1141017?ean=9780349142920): this was an entertaining read. It’s a well written character driven story.
- [Paris, Texas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087884/): this had been on my list for a while, so I leapt at the chance to see it in an open air cinema in Valencia. It was really great 💛
- [Paris is burning](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100332/): I got tickets for this film on Barbican’s open air cinema months ago, and it was so worth the wait, the ambiance was great, and the film was SO GOOD. A real treat.

    alt="Collage of pictures from August: Jonathan, a white man with dark hair and beard, sat at a restauran table eating crispy cauliflower; my dog Juno, a fluffy black german shepherd, looking out the window of my new flat on a sunny day; a table in a café, you can see a flat white in a yellow mug, a plate with a muffin topped with a tomato bean sauce and a poached egg, and you can also see an ipad with crosswords on the screen; the bedroom in my new flat, you can see a room with lots of natural light, a green chair and footstool under some shelves filled with books, a big monstera plant and a couple of boxes, you can also see Juno asleep sprawled on the floor; a close up of Juno asleep with his head resting on top of my stomach; some very fluffy clouds, shot sideways through a plane window; my hand with a fresh manicure, 2 nails are red, 1 is lilac, and the other 2 are half and half, split horizontally; my friend Marisa, a white woman with red wavy hair and I, a white woman with brown and grey wavy hair, side by side smiling at the camera; my friend Victor, a white man with black hair, black beard and black rimmed glasses and I, sort of smirking at the camera; the outdoor cinema in Valencia, it's night time and you can see some people sat in white plastic garden chairs, in the background you can see fairy lights hanging from palm tree to palm tree; a sideways shot of an old city gate in Valencia, on a sunny day; a grafitto of a rubber duck with a caption above that reads WTF; my friend Kelly's son, a blonde toddler sat on my lap while I put a shoe back on him; me sat in a restaurant, wearing a flowery dress and having a coffee; me in a bake off style tent baking a cake with one of my coworkers, during a work social; the outdoor cinema at the barbican, you can see people sat in chairs and red fairy lights hung around the seating area."
