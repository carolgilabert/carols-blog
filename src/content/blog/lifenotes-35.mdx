## ‚ú® Highlights

- I went to DDD East Midlands and it was really lovely to see a lot of my friends from the local tech scene again after a long time.
- My family came to visit and we did a lot of fun things with my mum, my sister and my youngest nephew.
  - We went to Hockley Hustle which is always good fun, we went shopping, we went for lots of nice food and had a nice time.
- My left nostril piercing healed enough to get my nose chain in ‚õìÔ∏è

## üéÆ Played/Read/Watched

- [Stop making sense](https://imdb.com/title/tt0088178) my local cinema advertised this as the best concert film ever made, so even though I wasn't a fan of The Talking Heads I went to see it and I really loved it.
- [Half A Million Kinksters Can‚Äôt Be Wrong](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/04/half-a-million-kinksters-can-t-be-wrong) by Aella
- [Sex education](https://imdb.com/title/tt7767422) series 4: I watched this sort of all in one go when I was off sick with a bad cold. I really loved Aimee‚Äôs arc this series about finding her voice through art, and I found something to cry about in basically every episode.
- [Too much and not enough](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/too-much-and-not-enough/) by Mandy Brown
- [The chair](https://imdb.com/title/tt11834150): I watched this because I really like Sandra Oh and it was short and sweet, and quite funny.
- [Little women](https://imdb.com/title/tt3281548): I watched this despite not loving period films but it was still really good fun, I enjoyed it. The actors were great and had a fun energy together.
- [GBBO](https://imdb.com/title/tt21958588): I did not enjoy this series as much as I enjoyed previous ones. I still watched it and it was still kind of fun but I think this is my last one.
- [The Most Important Management Concept You're Missing: Task Relevant Maturity](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/management-concept/) by Jason Evanish
- [Men in black](https://imdb.com/title/tt0119654): While my family was over we were looking for a good family film to watch together, so we watched this. I'd forgotten just how silly and fun it is.
- [Foe](https://imdb.com/title/tt8258502): I went to see this at my local cinema (big up [Broadway](https://broadway.org.uk/)!) and while the actors were very good and they put out good performances, I didn't really love the story so found it a bit meh.
- [Hereditary](https://imdb.com/title/tt7784604): I watched this at home on my own, and Juno was asleep the whole time so useless company really. There are some shocking scenes in this film, but I don't really struggle with those. However, the way the film built lots of tension throughout made me actually have to pause it a few times to regroup before continuing ü´£
- [My year of rest and relaxation](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation-ottessa-moshfegh/978286?ean=9781784707422) by Otessa Moshfegh: This was a fun read, it was more than a bit nihilistic but relatable.
