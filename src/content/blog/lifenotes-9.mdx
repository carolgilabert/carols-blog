## âœ¨ Highlights

- Got my first [Books that Matter](https://booksthatmatter.co.uk/) box ðŸ’•
- Finally got a stand up desk!

## ðŸŽ® Played/Read/Watched

- Started reading [Why I'm no longer talking to white people about race, by Reni Eddo-Lodge](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race-the-1-sunday-times-bestseller/9781408870587). Such a great book, lots of UK historical context which has been really interesting.
- [Notorious](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038787/): still really enjoy watching Hitchcock films, but I'm finding it very hard to get past the misogyny ðŸ˜¬
- [Black books](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262150/): started watching this as Thom likes it, it's great fun!
- [Parks and rec](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1266020/): we're rewatching this and omg, still makes me cackle regularly ðŸ˜‚
- [Lost in translation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/): it's one of Thom's faves and I hadn't seen it, so we fixed that. It was nice!
- [To catch a thief](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048728/): another Hitchcock one, pretty good.
- This [article about FLoC](https://adactio.com/journal/18046) by [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com) was a good read, explains the issue pretty well.
- [Another great read by Lara Hogan](https://larahogan.me/blog/we-need-to-talk-about-your-q3-roadmap/), this one encouraging managers to adjust their Q3 roadmaps to accommodate for folks' burnouts and general weariness accumulated over the last year and a bit.
- [This blog](https://jessitron.com/2021/03/27/those-pesky-pull-request-reviews/) by [Jessica Kerr](https://jessitron.com) was quite interesting, not sure I'd do away with PRs completely, but it sure is an interesting perspective, and I agree with a bunch of her points.
- [This article](https://ericwbailey.design/writing/how-to-make-an-ineffective-404-page/) by [Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.design) (included in [Cassidy Williams' newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/)) was super interesting! I guess I'd never thought too much about 404 pages and their purpose/impact. Would highly recommend a read ðŸ™‚
- [Control](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP4040-CUSA11454_00-CONTROLBUNDLESTN): I only played a tiny bit, but I'm already in love with the aesthetics! The fonts and colours are âœ¨ magical âœ¨
- I saw [this article](https://newrepublic.com/article/155141/cancel-culture-con-dave-chappelle-shane-gillis) linked amongst the fallout from the Basecamp debacle and it's a really good read on cancel culture.

Thom nuzzling Laika the dog, during a sunny day at the farm; 4. a bunch of white flowers in our cherry tree; 5. a tray of biscoff cupcakes, in red gingham wrappers; 6. a banana loaf, covered with icing and walnut pieces; 7. a mint armchair and footstool, which a grey wooly blanket and a couple of pink and green cushions on it."
