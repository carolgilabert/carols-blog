## ✨ Highlights

- We found a litter of hedgehogs living in our garden, so now we feed and check on them every day 🦔 💛
- Our garden has started to fruit, we got potatoes, lots of raspberries and even our corn is starting to grow.
- Seeing friends is always a nice treat 💛
- Got promoted, I'm a senior now 🎉
- Went back to Capoeira, it's been really nice to exercise and see my capo friends again 🤸🏼‍♀️
