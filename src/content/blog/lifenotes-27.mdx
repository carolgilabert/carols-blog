## ðŸŽ® Played/Read/Watched

- [The bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776): finally got around to watching this and it was great fun ðŸŽ‰
- [Roman holiday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046250): went my friend Rach to see it on the big screen, and it was lovely! Sometimes classic films have a level of misogyny that makes them hard to watch, but this one didnâ€™t, it was quite sweet.
- [White lotus](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13406094) series 2: was a bit meh, to be honest.
- [Argentina 1985](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15301048): watched this with my mum and sister when they came over and it was really good.
- [Braids and Bowlers: Indigenous Bolivian Women Skateboard in Style in Celia D. Lunaâ€™s Empowered Portraits](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2023/01/celia-luna-cholitas/)
- [I tried using AI. It scared me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPhJbKBuNnA) by Tom Scott
- [The killing of a sacred deer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5715874): I do like Yorgos Lanthimosâ€™ films in general, but this one was a bit meh.
- [Top boy: summerhouse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830379): loved this. Iâ€™d started the new series ages ago but only got through a couple of eps, so I went back to start from the beginning, and it was great. Made the new series better to me.
- [Shrinking](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15677150): my sister recommended this one to me and Iâ€™m really enjoying it. A good 30 min feel good comedy.
