## Quality over Quantity :)

## Update:

### To resolve all the merge conflicts:
1. Do not add your names in the contributor's list, we will do that on our own.

2. **Make sure to add a readme.md file with your project's description inside your project's folder.**
*From now onwards, no need to add the project description in project_doc.md file, instead so as mentioned above.*


## What to do?

1. Add any project, piece of code or script of your choice you wish to share in this repository.
   **Add your projects under the respective tech stack folder only**

2. <strike>Update project_doc.md file available in each project folder with the description of your project.</strike>
   



It can be any of any length and can be any number of scripts, just **add a folder with your projects name.**
